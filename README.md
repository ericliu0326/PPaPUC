# Programming: Principles and Practice Using C++ (2nd Edition)

## About
Starting my programming journey in C++ with Bjarne Stroustrup's Programming: Principles and 
Practice Using C++ (2nd Edition) textbook. Will be uploading my solutions to drills, try this,
and select exercises from each section. Wanted to create this repo to track my journey and
share some of my solutions. I found it extremely helpful to look for solutions written
by others to gain inspiration on improving and writing more efficient code and as such,
I figured sharing my code could potentially help others as well.

Please note I am starting with essentially 0 knowledge in programming and will be
revisiting / reviewing some of my code as I learn more.
